											<summary><b>Unit 1</b></summary>
                        <p>The module Principles of Digital Forensics and Cyber Law was introduced by an overview of the definitions of legislation and forensic measures, as well as the implications and limitations of cybercrime law and its importance in the context of criminal prosecution.
While the definition of cybercrime can be clearly defined, it was interesting for me to see that the national legal situation differs within continents and international criminal prosecution is not optimal. Although the development of the last two decades has shown great progress in terms of improved legal bases, due to globalization and the associated potential for cyber crimes, it seems difficult to implement appropriate criminal prosecution. The consideration of the challenges of combating cybercrime in the context of the technical, legal, ethical and operational dimensions was also an insight-expanding consideration.
The e-portfolio activity 1 (see Artefacts), which dealt with the question of what law is, could create an understanding of how legislation came about in the historical development and what were the driving forces for the development of the legal bodies known in the western world were and are (Conor, 2019). Also, looking at these in different nations has helped highlight similarities and differences to determine which dynamics contributed (Zeno-Zencovich, 2017).
A particularly interesting finding has turned out to be that the linguistic definition of law in everyday language can certainly differ. While the word law anticipates the legal basis for jurisprudence in the widest possible use, Espinosa (2018) uses the term law in the context of a scientific definition of a term. Here the term is used as a synonym for a rule or principle. This shows that the term law can be defined and understood in different ways. While both terms are subject to the stigma that they characterize an instruction that should be followed, the scientific term law implies a fundamental causal connection, while the legal term law characterizes humanistic constructs of social coexistence. This vagueness of the term should be taken into account in future considerations, otherwise it can lead to confusion.

											<summary><b>Unit 2</b></summary>
                        <p>The subject of this unit was the legal consideration of criminal prosecution in cyberspace, how digital evidence must be secured in order to meet forensic standards and what rights private individuals have in this context.
The evaluation of the fourth and fifth principles of American law regarding the protection of the privacy of individuals was very interesting as an exemplary analysis of legal bases for the collection of digital evidence. It was easy to emphasize here that the digital gathering of evidence is in a certain conflict with the right to privacy and that digital media may only be secured and evaluated if there is clear evidence (Holt et al., 2022). Very similar legal bases can be found in all western countries. However, there are also countries that legally require active help for the evaluation of data from their citizens. For example, people in Malaysia and India are obliged to allow access to their encrypted digital data in the event of suspicion, otherwise they could be liable to prosecution (Holt et al., 2022).
The comparison of forensics in the analogue space and in the digital space was revealing, since it was able to emphasize the great similarities and general principles that are to be applied to both spaces of forensics. It was also easy to see that the principles according to which digital forensics work are not really new structures, but are based on forensics principles that have been developed for a long time (Pollit, 2008).

											<summary><b>Unit 3</b></summary>
                        <p>The aim of this unit was to gain insights into forensic processes and to examine them in the context of the legal framework.
When looking at the standardized forensic processes historically, it is striking that they are based on principles that were developed in the early 20th century, the Locard's principles named after Edmond Locard. The principle states that with every crime, information about the course of the crime and the offender remains, which must be carefully examined, archived and put into context (DeBacco University, 2019). While various digital forensic models have been developed and presented since the 21st century, basic steps in the forensic process can be recorded. These are: acquisition of the evidence, preservation and storage, authentication process and analysis of the evidence. What is striking when considering the respective models is that they are based on a linear structure, which is based on the principle of thesis formation and subsequent validation. This can be traced back to the legal framework in which digital forensics takes place. Since investigations may only take place if there is initial suspicion, forensic investigations may only take place within this framework and with the aim of finding evidence for this explicit crime. The principle of proportionality must be observed here. Corresponding hardware may only be examined if there are sufficient indications that justify the examination of digital media; a general examination without prior reasonable suspicion is unlawful. During the gathering of the evidence during the course of the forensic procedure, it must be ensured at all times that no changes are made to the digital evidence. The conscientious archiving of the original data, the replication and the proof by SHA key, for example, is of central importance, so that evidence must also be used in criminal proceedings against the accused. The burden of proof lies with the investigators. In the legal sense, this can be traced back to the principle: "in dubio pro reo" (in case of doubt for the accused) (Alexy et al., 2019). The question was also raised as to whether the legal basis on which cybercrime is prosecuted meets the demands of today's digital criminal prosecution due to technical progress. An in-depth investigation can be found in the e-Portfolio Activity 2: Computer Forensics – The Investigative Process under Artefacts.
