											<summary><b>Unit 1</b></summary>
                      <p>At the beginning of the module, an examination of common definitions of information risk management was made and Information Security Management concepts were introduced. Furthermore, a discussion on the definition of the terms risk and risk management and approaches to quantitative and qualitative assessment options was carried out within the framework of the seminar. Getting started with the module provided a general introduction to the topic. A lot of what was already discussed in the previous module, "Network and Information Security Management", was taken up again and the knowledge was refreshed. I see the fact that there is no agreed definition of risk as such, and that it is interpreted differently by different sources, as a finding that needs to be emphasized. As a result, finding suitable evaluation criteria can be made more difficult. As a general but fundamentally satisfactory definition, I think the equation Risk = Threat * Vulnerability * Asset can be used. This shows the aspects that contribute to the creation of the risk, but also establishes that risk is a quantifiable value. Another question to be reflected is whether an assessment of risk should be undertaken on a purely quantitative level, or whether a qualitative assessment also has a right to exist? While an obvious answer to the question could be 'Yes, within the scope of the possible applications', the question arises as to what applicable use a purely qualitative assessment has in the context of Information Risk Management, since such an assessment has no comparable value other security aspects and also no directly usable comparison of companies is possible. A risk that is classified as 'high' in one company may only be 'medium' or 'low' in another company on the basis of proportionality. Two risks can also be classified as 'high', but have completely different consequences if a breach occurs. While an information disclosure breach can generate reputation and financial damage and is therefore classified as 'high', a tampering breach, which is also defined as 'high', can result in the entire database being deleted and the company being unable to act. Both events have a high impact on the company, however, in one case the image will be damaged and financial damage may occur, while in the other situation the company may become incapacitated. In this example, it is noticeable that comparability on a qualitative level is difficult. One could now argue that the risk of information disclosure can also be classified as 'medium' and thus a ranking is created, but there are many other risk scenarios, so that a subdivision of 'lowest', 'low', 'medium', 'high', 'highest' arises. At this point at the latest, it is noticeable that further subdivision inevitably results in a quantitative evaluation matrix, since the terms should be given better than a numerical value from a certain number. This leads to the simple conclusion that an Information Risk Management investigation, if considered sufficiently in-depth, always results in a quantitative assessment. Due to the lack of participants in the seminar, the discussion was unfortunately limited, so that this argumentation approach could not be addressed satisfactorily. However, it shows how complex information risk management and the definition of suitable evaluation criteria and definitions can be.</p>

											<summary><b>Unit 2</b></summary>
                      <p>The subject of this unit was a discussion between qualitative and quantitative assessment approaches. The positive influence of user participation in the risk management process was also discussed. While the application of qualitative and quantitative risk management assessment methods raised questions in the last unit, a better idea could be developed in this unit. The understanding of the respective advantages of the evaluation approaches in the respective situations leads to a better assessment of possible applications. This includes the realization that, depending on the context, a qualitative or quantitative assessment is preferable. Especially in situations where a quantitative assessment can give a misleading picture of a complete understanding of all parameters, a qualitative assessment should be considered. Furthermore, there are contexts in which a quantitative assessment is difficult or impossible. The discussion in the seminar was able to provide many insights. Considering the positive influences of users on the risk management process has also opened up a new perspective. While in many studies one of the greatest risks for security incidents is due to insider threats, positive factors of participation in security infrastructures could be identified during the unit and the seminar session (Giandomenico & Groot, 2020). The study by Spears & Barki (2010) has shown that the participation of users in risk management not only creates greater awareness of the importance of security aspects and their importance, but can also increase the efficiency of the security department. In addition, users can contribute to increasing the quality of the security infrastructure with their business-related perspective, since they are the active users of this infrastructure and can therefore impart practical experience and application-related knowledge about the system. This knowledge moves the users of an application from a potential source of danger to a positive influence. Changing perspectives and emphasizing positive user impacts on security is important to harness the potential of this resource to ensure security infrastructures are as effective as possible.</p>

											<summary><b>Unit 3</b></summary>
                      <p>The aim of this unit was to gain insights into the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and to examine methods with which the process can be carried out and improved. Furthermore, risks were determined in the individual phases of the SDLC and mitigation measures were determined. In the historical considerations of the development of SDLC methods, it is noticeable that there was a move away from the waterfall method towards agile methods and that these have advantages compared to the waterfall method due to time aspects but also security aspects. Breaking the linear and rigid course of software development and implementation enables faster and more application-oriented development, in which the interests of the stakeholders are brought to the fore. For me, this change in development towards customer-oriented software development is, on the one hand, a purely logical process in order to react to the requirements of interest groups in relation to the rapidly growing market of digitization and SaaS and, on the other hand, to do justice to the security aspects of such a development (Soofi et al., 2014). I also consider an agile SDLC approach to be more product-oriented, since the requirements for the software can change during the development process and the ultimately expected features of the software may not be achieved with a rigid structure. Furthermore, the Agile approach offers more opportunities to influence new security gaps and vulnerabilities, so that a potentially more secure program can be developed. The DevOps approach can also contribute to this (Bass, 2018). The consideration of the risks in the individual phases of the SDLC has shown which priorities must be set in the individual phases of development. It was interesting to see which individual aspects have to be considered and the form in which risks can occur. The status Report, which is completed and submitted in this unit, helps to develop further competencies within the framework of risk management. This provides a basis for the Risk Assessment Report planned later on, which will examine these aspects in more detail and thus train the competence of reflected risk awareness and risk assessment, as well as analysis.</p>
