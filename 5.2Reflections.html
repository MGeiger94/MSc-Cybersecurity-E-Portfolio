											<summary><b>Unit 1</b></summary>
                      <p>At the beginning of the module, techniques were learned that can be used in the development and creation of secure software to optimize the process. This includes the waterfall and agile approaches to software development, such as the SCRUM approach. The standards for the secure development of software were also emphasized and an introduction to UML models was given again. Working in a team is subject to various challenges that must be met in order to achieve optimal efficiency. Especially in view of the fact that in this module software is to be created within six weeks, smooth and productive teamwork is of high priority in order to be able to use the time efficiently and in a goal-oriented manner. The techniques discussed in this unit help here, although it must be differentiated which technique is most suitable for the module. Due to the limited time in which the software is to be developed, only an agile technique such as the SCRUM approach offers the appropriate flexibility and timing to create a product that is as finished as possible in a short time. This approach also offers the possibility of creating a finished product in different instances, so that the final product can be variable, depending on the development speed and requirements. Beyond the theory, however, this approach still has to be validated in a practical test in the team over the next few weeks in order to be able to develop a considered opinion on this variable approach. The reflected consideration of the standards in relation to the secure development of software offered an overview of the previous standards and regulations of the last modules. Although no new insights were gained, a change of perspective was made in a certain way, since the relevant standards and regulations are now not only analyzed and examined in the context of case studies, but also have to be considered when creating your own software. The same applies to the UML models. Since the models have only been used up to now to recreate existing structures, the models should now offer a possibility to support structured work in the team. Thus, the reflective handling and an understanding of conventions are of high priority in order to be able to exploit the potential of these presentation options.</p>

											<summary><b>Unit 2</b></summary>
                      <p>The aim of this unit was to develop possibilities for the integration of software security development practices in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and to understand the challenges of software security. In order to develop general skills in dealing with software security, the ISO/IEC definitions of terms were examined (ISO, 2018). In order to train the application-related correct handling of these definitions, a blog entry was written about the dangers and mitigation approaches of employees in relation to security threats. The result of this blog entry was not only that terminology and awareness of dealing with terms in the context of cyber security was acquired, but also the importance of the potential danger for threats from internal sources was addressed. Since more than 50% of all security breaches are caused by employees, this represents an important aspect in the development of secure software (Giandomenico & Groot, 2020). This once again made it clear to me the importance of the 'least privilege principle' and the 'zero trust approach'. Such insights form the basis for the design of secure software, since often only external factors are taken into account in such a development and internal factors are overlooked or given less consideration. The seminar also discussed which factors should be given the greatest importance for the development of secure software. It was highlighted that design, as opposed to the language used and testing, has the greatest impact on successful secure software development. However, it should be noted that the other two factors, the programming language used, as well as testing and penetration testing, have a major impact on the final product. All of these factors have a great influence and can also influence each other. Furthermore, it was found in the seminar session that Python offers some advantages for secure software. Python doesn't store new input in an old memory space, but creates a new one, while the old memory space is cleared by the garbage collector. This represents an advantage over other programming languages such as C.</p>

											<summary><b>Unit 3</b></summary>
                      <p>The aim of the unit was to get an overview of the history and concepts of programming languages. Security aspects as well as advantages and disadvantages of selected programming languages were also examined and discussed whether Python can be described as a 'safe programming language'. When looking at the historical development of programming languages, an interesting finding was the extent to which the individual programming languages are intertwined and the rapid development of new languages from 1985 onwards (Sestoft, 2020). When technically examining selected programming languages such as C, Python, Java, Ruby and Pearl, it is noticeable that each individual language offers its advantages and disadvantages in terms of security aspects (Cifuentes & Bierman, 2019). Based on this consideration, it is difficult for me to give a clear statement about the thesis whether Python can be classified as a 'safe programming language'. However, it should also be emphasized here that the term 'secure' is a difficult one to define precisely, as one might assume that 'secure' in this context could mean the absence of any threat or vulnerability. Under this assumption, no programming language is secure. However, there are programming languages that pay more attention to security than others. Given that 'secure' in this context means that a programming language offers basic possibilities to prevent or mitigate vulnerabilities, Python could be called a secure programming language. With this assumption, it is up to the programmer and the choice of design for the software to increase the security of a program and reduce vulnerabilities. However, it should be noted that in order to actively mitigate vulnerabilities, these must also be known. Python is a very popular and widely used programming language, which means that many studies on known and common vulnerabilities are available. This makes it easier to understand potential risks when writing the code, thereby increasing security.</p>
