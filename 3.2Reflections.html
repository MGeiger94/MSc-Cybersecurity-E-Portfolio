											<h2>Weekly reflections of the individual units:</h2>

											<summary>Unit 1</summary>
											<p>The aim of this unit was to analyze the basic principles of information security management, to gain an understanding of the meaning and definition of the terms threat and vulnerability in the context of information security, and to gain a knowledge about different roles for eliminating vulnerabilities in programs, systems and networks. In the Collaborative Discussion 1, cyber threats related to medical devices were discussed using the example of a medical mannequin. A team contract was also drawn up, which should regulate future work in the group.
The insight into the principles of information security management gave me an overview of the general requirements in the area of information security management. The information obtained was nothing new to me, as this was already discussed in the previous module. However, the renewed examination of the principles showed me the importance. The mantra of the CIA is a fundamental part of the development and troubleshooting of network applications and offers me the anchor points of my work for my professional future (Fenrich, 2008).
In relation to this, an initial examination of cyber threats to medical devices has shown me the practical importance of the principles. By dealing with a topic that was completely new for me, the medical industry and its developments in the field of IoMT, I was able to examine the central threats and vulnerabilities, deal with potential consequences and consider possible preventive measures for the threats. This examination of the subject has shown me the importance of protective measures and the direct consequences of disregarding them in the field of cyber security. It was interesting to see the manifold possibilities for the corruption of medical devices and which solutions are available for prevention (Xu et al., 2019). It was a shocking finding that optimal protection with regard to all technical aspects and their requirements, especially in the area of implants, proves to be extremely difficult, since functions, areas of application and necessary measures often interfere with one another. For example, the size of an implant, its longest possible runtime and necessary protective measures, through firewalls and filters. This realization gives me the incentive to find solutions to these problems in order to be able to make a contribution to social and medical development in the future. However, this also shows me that I still have to learn a lot of experience and skills in order to be able to make this contribution.
The cooperation in my team and the joint development of the team contract sent a positive signal to me. Even if individual team members did not show up on time for the meeting, the contract could be drawn up together in a constructive manner. My previously drawn up contract, which was used as the basis for the mutual agreement, was useful here. All points listed by me have been taken over completely or in a modified form. So my work has had positive benefits for my team. However, it would have been nice if all team members had participated more evenly. However, it is to be expected that this will be the case in the next team meetings. The first meeting with my team showed me that there is a respectful approach and that all group members have a fundamental interest.
