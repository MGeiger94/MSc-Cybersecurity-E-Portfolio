											<summary>Unit 1</summary>
											<p>The aim of this unit was to analyze the basic principles of information security management, to gain an understanding of the meaning and definition of the terms threat and vulnerability in the context of information security, and to gain a knowledge about different roles for eliminating vulnerabilities in programs, systems and networks. In the Collaborative Discussion 1, cyber threats related to medical devices were discussed using the example of a medical mannequin. A team contract was also drawn up, which should regulate future work in the group.
The insight into the principles of information security management gave me an overview of the general requirements in the area of information security management. The information obtained was nothing new to me, as this was already discussed in the previous module. However, the renewed examination of the principles showed me the importance. The mantra of the CIA is a fundamental part of the development and troubleshooting of network applications and offers me the anchor points of my work for my professional future (Fenrich, 2008).
In relation to this, an initial examination of cyber threats to medical devices has shown me the practical importance of the principles. By dealing with a topic that was completely new for me, the medical industry and its developments in the field of IoMT, I was able to examine the central threats and vulnerabilities, deal with potential consequences and consider possible preventive measures for the threats. This examination of the subject has shown me the importance of protective measures and the direct consequences of disregarding them in the field of cyber security. It was interesting to see the manifold possibilities for the corruption of medical devices and which solutions are available for prevention (Xu et al., 2019). It was a shocking finding that optimal protection with regard to all technical aspects and their requirements, especially in the area of implants, proves to be extremely difficult, since functions, areas of application and necessary measures often interfere with one another. For example, the size of an implant, its longest possible runtime and necessary protective measures, through firewalls and filters. This realization gives me the incentive to find solutions to these problems in order to be able to make a contribution to social and medical development in the future. However, this also shows me that I still have to learn a lot of experience and skills in order to be able to make this contribution.
The cooperation in my team and the joint development of the team contract sent a positive signal to me. Even if individual team members did not show up on time for the meeting, the contract could be drawn up together in a constructive manner. My previously drawn up contract, which was used as the basis for the mutual agreement, was useful here. All points listed by me have been taken over completely or in a modified form. So my work has had positive benefits for my team. However, it would have been nice if all team members had participated more evenly. However, it is to be expected that this will be the case in the next team meetings. The first meeting with my team showed me that there is a respectful approach and that all group members have a fundamental interest.</p>

											<summary>Unit 2</summary>
											<p>In this unit, vulnerabilities of modern electronic devices were examined and possibilities were determined with which threats can be classified and vulnerabilities can be analyzed with regard to their hazard potential. Two of the analysis tools that can be used in any cyber security environment are the STRIDE and DREAD tools. For the seminar 1 session, the DREAD analysis tool was used to assess potential threats in relation to the medical devices discussed in Collaborative Discussion 1 and the IoMT according to their potential danger. The results determined by the respective groups were presented and compared in seminar 1.
The analysis tools (STRIDE and DREAD) offer a good basic analysis of vulnerabilities and threats from network components and are therefore useful in all conceivable sectors of cyber security, as well as in medical health care (Alhassan et al., 2016). While I was already familiar with the STRIDE analysis tool, working with the DREAD tool gave me additional skills in cyber threat analysis.
 I see the knowledge that both analysis tools symbiosis extremely well with each other as particularly beneficial. While the STRIDE tool offers a qualitative assessment of the possible threats, the DREAD tool enables a quantitative assessment, whereby an assessment of the prioritization of the vulnerabilities to be closed can be carried out. The SRIDE tool thus offers a first starting point and overview of potential dangers and the DREAD tool a further step to evaluate these through a ranking.
The work in the team was of great benefit to me, as I did not found the source on which the presentation of the groups in the seminar session should be based. Therefore, I first researched other sources and found what I was looking for in an empirical study of cyber vulnerabilities in a medical context (Xu et al., 2019). With this source it was possible to develop a ranking of possible vulnerabilities, but did not fulfill the stated task, which aimed to develop a personal assessment of threats. My team helped me here by having a team member find the source and share it with us. In the further exchange, the task could be completed satisfactorily. Both assessment approaches can be found in Seminar 1 Powerpoint.
The productive exchange in my group was therefore an extremely profitable result for me, as it resulted in a discussion which, through my personal assessment, broadened my personal knowledge horizon. It should be noted here, however, that the participation in the team of the respective members is very different and some show a greater motivation to work together than others.

											<summary>Unit 3</summary>
											<p>This unit focused on the fundamental concepts of networks, how they enable data transmission and which tools can be used for network analysis to identify potential problems. The standards of the Internet Protocols (IP) of IPv4 and IPv6 were also compared. Furthermore, the Collaborative Disscussion 1 was completed in this unit.
The literature provided and the Lecturecast have built on my existing knowledge and expanded my knowledge with new information and findings. I was familiar with the Internet structures, such as the TCP / IP model used for data transmission and its structure and functionality. The ISO / OSI 7-layer model, on the other hand, was unknown to me up to this point and a comparison of these two models, which have similarities and yet differences from one another, gave me a better understanding of the TCP / IP model and showed me that it exists next to the standard in use other approaches for the Internet.
Tools for examining networks and troubleshooting were previously unknown to me. It was extremely interesting to use these basic tools and to find out information about the routers used and the hosting service provider for the website. Since I work with a Windows 10 OS, some tools, such as the dig command, were not available without further installations. Since I initially wanted to refrain from installing these tools, I tried other programs and online offers to obtain the information. It was amazing how easy it was to get information about service providers and free applications. However, this also made me wonder how easy it is for malicious people to obtain information from websites in order to spy on them for possible cyber attacks. A first examination of the tools for scanning a website piqued my interest in the applied examination of websites and troubleshooting. However, I quickly realized that my knowledge is still extremely limited in this context and that I have to develop further in this direction in order to become a competent cyber security specialist.
The Collaborative Discussion 1 was extremely productive from my point of view. Some responses were made to my initial post, which gave me a lot of additional information and was able to look at it from different perspectives. This multitude of aspects and perspectives made it easy for me to write a summary post that takes up the topic and rounds it off. However, the word limit has presented a challenge, as it has proven extremely difficult for me to limit such a complex and comprehensive topic to 300 words. The summary post can be found under the Artefacts.

											<summary>Unit 4</summary>
											<p>The core of the unit were practical exercises with tools for basic troubleshooting. With the help of the tools, the results were analyzed and discussed within and between the teams. The ISO / OSI 7-layer and TCP / IP models should also be compared and a discussion should be prepared as to whether the Internet that exists today would be better with the OSI / ISO 7-layer model. Both topics were addressed in the seminar session.
As noted in the previous unit, the tools for basic troubleshooting were new to me. Also because of the Windows 10 operating system I used, I had initial problems doing some of the investigations I wanted. I was able to receive help and exchange from a team member who already had a deeper understanding of the subject and thus answered a few questions and supported me in my practical investigation. The teamwork was of great benefit to me here, as I was able to develop a lot of information and networked understanding in a short time. Unfortunately, only the two of us took part in the discussion, otherwise other team members could have benefited from the discussion or contributed to mutual development through their input. Also, due to the lack of participation in the group meetings and the lack of communication, it must be assumed that two of the team members will no longer participate in the module. Although this is sad for the further module, it is also an experience that can occur in a professional environment. It can always happen that individual team members of a project are absent and therefore a new planning of the action plan of a project has to be made. Flexibility and the ability to adapt to new circumstances are therefore skills that are of high priority in professional practice (Horwitz & Townshend, 2006).
The seminar session in Unit 4 comprised two thematic blocks. While the presentation and discussion of the results of the practical team activity from Unit 3 can be rated as extremely profitable by me, I had higher expectations from the discussion about the TCP / IP and ISO / OSI 7-layer models. So I found it very interesting to compare the respective results of the groups with my own and to find that these, apart from the traceroute investigation, which differed due to the respective location of the investigation, yielded the same results. Thus, the own work could be validated and the different approaches could be compared. In my investigation and evaluation of the models with regard to the question of whether the Internet that exists today would be a better one with the ISO / OSI layer model, I did not come to a clear conclusion. A discussion in the seminar would have made sense for me under certain circumstances, since different opinions and perspectives could have led me to a more well-founded decision. Unfortunately, the other seminar participants were not sufficiently informed to have an active discussion. Therefore my arguments could only be discussed with the tutor, which confirmed my assessment and was able to get a more solid picture. However, further perspectives and arguments from my fellow students could have led to an even more comprehensive understanding.

											<summary>Unit 5</summary>
											<p>The subject of this unit was to develop an understanding of network components. Various penetration testing tools were also examined and evaluated according to their handling and possible applications in troubleshooting. As part of the collaborative discussion 2, the respective investigations were discussed and further tests were carried out.
The Lecturecast “Network Tools and Components” gave me a good overview of the components used in networks and encouraged me to do further research. While the areas of application and functionality of LAN and WAN were already known, it was very interesting for me to see how far the historical development of Network Operating Systems (NOS) goes back and which hurdles had to be overcome. The consideration of cloud systems and VM models was also extremely interesting. Although I was aware of cloud providers, I hadn't thought about the respective classification and their respective benefits beforehand. Since a shift from print files to digital storage of files can be observed due to the advancing development of computers and networks in the last decades and with the introduction of cloud computing a renewed shift of the storage of files from local machines to clouds can be observed, clouds and their service providers present new opportunities in the coming future, but also dangers in relation to malicious interference by hackers (Singh & Chatterjee, 2017).
In order to examine websites and networks for their vulnerabilities, there are a large number of penetration testing tools, which are available for a fee or as a free version and provide various analysis options. Because of this large number, it makes sense to first evaluate selected analysis tools. The evaluation exercise helped me to get an overview of the wide range of these tools. Since I was not previously aware of any of these tools, I considered it extremely beneficial to further investigate these tools discussed in the source (Geer, 2015). I would probably not have undertaken such a targeted examination of the tools without the exercise. It was of great use, however, as it gave me, in addition to the considerations in terms of practicality, thoughts about the aspects of privacy. A reflection on the personal provision of information to third parties should be of central importance for every person who works with confidential information from companies, which applies to the profession of cyber security specialist.
Since the results of the basic troubleshooting from the previous units were discussed in Collaborative Discussion 2, which presented a new challenge for me, I focused on carrying out further investigations with various online tools. It was also important to me to run the analysis tools on my OS, so I installed tools for the CMD app on my OS, for example to be able to perform the dig command on my Windows 10. This enabled me to re-validate my previous results and to gain some troubleshooting skills.

											<summary>Unit 6</summary>
											<p>In this unit the assessments were submitted and the network scanning tools and their respective evaluation were discussed in the seminar.
Since I was limited in time this week, I started working on the team project early on. From Unit 2 I worked on a section of the project every week, so that at the beginning of Unit 5 a rough plan of the assessment was in place and made available to my team. On the basis of this preliminary work and the extremely productive processing and addition of a team member, the design document for the assessment was drawn up. The creation of this document took up the aspects of Network and Information Security Management discussed in the previous units well and placed them in a practical context. This enabled the knowledge gained to be applied to a case study and an analysis of it to be carried out. Working together on this project was profitable for me, as the exchange resulted in additional arguments and aspects that I did not take into account in the final work and thus broadened my knowledge horizon.
Since two of my team members no longer take part in the module and the work in my team is very different, it was a challenge for me to create the peer review design document. It has turned out to be difficult to give a fair evaluation of my team members, as it intuitively seemed unfair to evaluate someone worse and thus to have a negative influence on the grading. However, after a few deliberations and reflections, I decided to make an appropriate assessment of my team members, as an inadequate appreciation of the people who contributed significantly to the creation of this assessment would also not correspond to the aspect of fairness.
When discussing network scanning tools, it turned out that both teams that presented their results had similar results. The ratings were the same in many respects, such as the rating of Jawfish as the worst tool of the presented ones. However, both teams rated another tool as the best. Based on the overlap and the differences, it can be determined that a rating of the tools cannot be viewed as one-dimensional and completely objective. Different aspects and arguments, which speak for or against a tool, are differently important to the users of the tools. This also explains the wide range of penetration testing tools. Users have different interests and priorities that the tools have to meet. When comparing the two results of the teams, it is noticeable that most of the tools examined are rated close together, so that it is difficult to clearly distinguish between good and bad tools. It should therefore always be considered in which context the respective application is used.
