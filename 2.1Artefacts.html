										<h3>Initial Post</h3>		
											
									<p> The European parliament and the council (2016: 1) declared that: “the protection of natural persons in relation to the processing of personal data is a fundamental right”,   as well as of intangible and physical property. To uphold this fundamental right, it is the task of companies, but also government organizations, to take care of the safety of customers and citizens. A breach of this duty of supervision can not only result in reputational damage, but also massive financial damage to people and companies, the leak of personal information, intellectual property or infrastructural damage. <p>
									<p> In March 2021, Microsoft's email transport server software, Microsoft Exchange, fell victim to a cyber breach (Morgan, 2021). Microsoft Exchange is a groupware and e-mail transport server software from Microsoft, which is also part of the Office 365 service. It is used for the central storage and management of e-mails, appointments, contacts, tasks and other elements for several users and thus enables collaboration in work groups, which makes the service particularly interesting for companies (Microsoft, 2021a). The program enables internal company planning and communication to be carried out so that sensitive data is stored on the servers (Microsoft, 2021b). The cyber attack on Microsoft Exchange infected more than 120,000 systems (Turton, 2021). The hack was so significant that the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) stepped in and removed the vulnerability without the companies' knowledge (Collier, 2021). <p>
									<p> The Cyber Security Breaches Survey of 2019 shows that the priority of Cyber Security has increased compared to previous years. Between 2017 and 2019 the costs to companies in the United Kingdom from cyber breaches roughly doubled (Department of Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, 2019: 53). This indicates that cyber attacks are becoming increasingly important and not only companies but also government agencies are interested in Cyber Security. VanSyckel (2018:7) notes that absolute security in cyber space is not possible. It can be concluded from this that cyber security will continue to gain in importance in the future, as further networking with the Internet can lead to new and potentially more dangerous cyber attacks.With this in mind, the designated president of the United States of America Joe Biden, indicated that: “it is more likely we were going to end up in a war, a real shooting war, when a major power it is going to be as a consequence of a cyber breach of great consequence is increasing exponentially” (Bose, 2021). <p>

										<h3>Peer Resoponse 1 </h3>
										
										<p>Very good summary Aldo. With your example with Wannacry ransomware, you addressed one of the most widespread cyber attacks in history. Wannacry's story could be read like a crime thriller.</p>
										<p>WannaCry is based on EternalBlue, an exploit of the MS17-010 vulnerability in Microsoft's NetBIOS (Heise, 2017). The United States National Security Agency (NSA) developed and used this vulnerability under the name EternalBlue for five years without informing Microsoft about the security vulnerability (Farand, 2017). Only after EternalBlue was stolen from the NSA did the agency inform Microsoft about the security breach. Microsoft then released updates to close the vulnerability in March 2017. However, these updates were only for the still supported operating systems Windows Vista and newer (Goodin, 2017).</p>
										<p>Since the Windows XP operating system was not protected by the patch, the malware could cause such great damage. The WannaCry cyber attack in May 2017 affected over 230,000 computers in nearly 150 countries. Due to its scale, Europol has been described this cyber attack as an unprecedented event (BBC, 2017).</p>
										<p>A large number of internationally operating companies were affected by the cyber attack. These include the Spanish telecommunications group Telefónica, the British National Health Service (NHS), the US logistics company FedEX and automotive groups such as Renault and Nissan, as well as the Chinese oil company PetroChina.</p>
										<p>It is ironic that an agency like the NSA, which is responsible for the safety of its people, is responsible for causing such great national and global damage. On the other hand, such an incident shows the importance of cyber security in today's world and how important it is to keep the operating system up to date.</p>

										<h3>Peer Resopnse 2 </h3>
										<p>Thank you very much for your post Jitesh. With the British Aiways cyber breach case, you addressed a quite interesting industry in relation to cyber attacks.</p>
										<p>Airlines have particularly sensitive data about their customers and are therefore subject to a special duty of care. Not only do they have personal data such as names, nationalities, home addresses, ID cards and, if applicable, account numbers of their customers, they also have information about people's physical movement activity.</p>
										<p>While air traffic has decreased due to COVID-19 in recent years, an increase in flights must be expected again in the next few years. In 2019, 4.5 billion passengers were transported in the air, 3.6 percent more than in 2018 (ICAO, 2020). Every fifth traveler is a business traveler. With more than 30% of the turnover, business travelers make up a large and particularly lucrative share of the turnover of an airline (U.S. Travel Association, 2021).</p>
										<p>Belarusian journalist Roman Protasevich shows that a leak of information can have drastic consequences for airline customers. In May 2020, the aircraft in which he was sitting was diverted from their route by the Belarusian air force and forced to land in Belarus in order to arrest him (BBC, 2020).</p>
										<p>It is clear from this that airlines have a special responsibility with regard to cyber security, since a leak of sensitive data from their customers can not only result in the theft of their data, but also physical consequences for them and international political tensions.</p>

										<h3>Peer Response 3 </h3>
										<p>Thank you Kingsley for your extremely interesting post, which inspired me to reflect critically on ethical cyber security. </p>
										<p>In July 2016, the North Atlantic Tready Organization (NATO) published a Cyber Defense Pledge, which addresses the security threats posed by cyber attacks and is intended to improve the cyber defense of the national infrastructure (Christen et al., 2020: 206).</p>
										<p>A cyber attack on the Iranian power grid that took place in 2010 shows that this goal is of great importance. In June 2010, a malicious computer worm named Stuxnet was discovered that was specially developed to monitor and control a Siemens system. The system controls  frequency converters that have the task of regulating the speed of motors (Fallier et al., 2010: 32-42). Such frequency converters are used for industrial plants such as waterworks, but also uranium enrichment plants and nuclear power plants. In September 2010, Iran confirmed Stuxnet's cyberattacks. 30,000 computers are said to have been affected without causing serious damage, but the power grid was affected (Heise, 2010).</p>
										<p>How credible this statement is, however, is doubtful, since both parties allegedly involved, the USA and Iran, subsequently denied the development or the damage (Spiegel, 2010). It was only found in 2012 that, contrary to the statement, the USA and Israel had commissioned the development of the software (Nakashima &  Warrick, 2012). The following years show that this software was not only used for its (probably) original purpose. In 2012, it is believed that the developers of the malware lost control of the program (Anderson 2012). In 2014 the malware was found in a German nuclear power plant. Espionage is presumed to be the intension (University of Hawai’I, N.D.). </p>
										<p>However, what a malicious, destructive intervention in nuclear power plants could mean can be seen in the two accidents in Chernobyl and Fukushima, in which errors in the control system (in both cases due to a technical failure) led to a nuclear catastrophe. It is therefore not wrong to claim that: "Cyberspace is now seen as the fifth military battlefield alongside ground, air, water and space" (Heise, 2010).</p>
										<p>On the basis of this history, every cyber security specialist, but also programmer in general, should be clear about the scope of their actions in order to be able to make ethically correct decisions.</p>

										<h3>Summary Post</h3>
										
										<p>Cyber security is a multi-dimensional subject area that has to be considered on complex levels and has to meet various demands of aspects. <p>
										<p>While companies have to fear long-term damage to their reputation as a result of a cyber attack in addition to data loss, a cyber breach can affect the democratic system in relation to nations (Troncoso, 2019). In addition to the ethical consideration on a large scale, a cyber breach has drastic consequences for private individuals, as the theft of sensitive personal data not only encroaches on their fundamental rights, but also has direct consequences, such as the theft of financial and intellectual property or even physical hazards, as a result of publication of the place of residence(Ben-Hassine, n.d.). Therefore, Governments have a great interest in monitoring and actively defending in the event of a cyber attack by intervening in corporate systems and supporting companies in closing cyber breaches in order to maintain security (National Cyber Security Centre, n.d.). Even if systems can never be completely secure, companies for their part have the responsibility to design their cyber presence and offerings in such a way that they meet the requirements of their customers and the law, as well as that a cyber breach can be ruled out as far as possible (Mokhor et al., 2020). <p>
										<p>To pursue this goal, the CIA triad model can be used, which addresses the three aspects of information security in a service-related system. These are confidentiality, the protection against access to private data by third parties. Integrity, the security that data is not manipulated and availability, the guarantee of continuous access to the data by authorized persons. (Chai, n.d.) <p>
										<p>In conclusion, it can be stated that cyber security is of great importance for private individuals, companies and also nations and will become more necessary as a result of further networking and development. <p>
