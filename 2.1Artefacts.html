										<h3>Initial Post</h3>		
											
									<p> The European parliament and the council (2016: 1) declared that: “the protection of natural persons in relation to the processing of personal data is a fundamental right”,   as well as of intangible and physical property. To uphold this fundamental right, it is the task of companies, but also government organizations, to take care of the safety of customers and citizens. A breach of this duty of supervision can not only result in reputational damage, but also massive financial damage to people and companies, the leak of personal information, intellectual property or infrastructural damage. 
									<br> In March 2021, Microsoft's email transport server software, Microsoft Exchange, fell victim to a cyber breach (Morgan, 2021). Microsoft Exchange is a groupware and e-mail transport server software from Microsoft, which is also part of the Office 365 service. It is used for the central storage and management of e-mails, appointments, contacts, tasks and other elements for several users and thus enables collaboration in work groups, which makes the service particularly interesting for companies (Microsoft, 2021a). The program enables internal company planning and communication to be carried out so that sensitive data is stored on the servers (Microsoft, 2021b). The cyber attack on Microsoft Exchange infected more than 120,000 systems (Turton, 2021). The hack was so significant that the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) stepped in and removed the vulnerability without the companies' knowledge (Collier, 2021). 
									<br> The Cyber Security Breaches Survey of 2019 shows that the priority of Cyber Security has increased compared to previous years. Between 2017 and 2019 the costs to companies in the United Kingdom from cyber breaches roughly doubled (Department of Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, 2019: 53). This indicates that cyber attacks are becoming increasingly important and not only companies but also government agencies are interested in Cyber Security. VanSyckel (2018:7) notes that absolute security in cyber space is not possible. It can be concluded from this that cyber security will continue to gain in importance in the future, as further networking with the Internet can lead to new and potentially more dangerous cyber attacks.With this in mind, the designated president of the United States of America Joe Biden, indicated that: “it is more likely we were going to end up in a war, a real shooting war, when a major power it is going to be as a consequence of a cyber breach of great consequence is increasing exponentially” (Bose, 2021).

										<h3>Peer Resoponse 1 </h3>
										
										<p>Very good summary Aldo. With your example with Wannacry ransomware, you addressed one of the most widespread cyber attacks in history. Wannacry's story could be read like a crime thriller.
										<br>WannaCry is based on EternalBlue, an exploit of the MS17-010 vulnerability in Microsoft's NetBIOS (Heise, 2017). The United States National Security Agency (NSA) developed and used this vulnerability under the name EternalBlue for five years without informing Microsoft about the security vulnerability (Farand, 2017). Only after EternalBlue was stolen from the NSA did the agency inform Microsoft about the security breach. Microsoft then released updates to close the vulnerability in March 2017. However, these updates were only for the still supported operating systems Windows Vista and newer (Goodin, 2017).
										<br>Since the Windows XP operating system was not protected by the patch, the malware could cause such great damage. The WannaCry cyber attack in May 2017 affected over 230,000 computers in nearly 150 countries. Due to its scale, Europol has been described this cyber attack as an unprecedented event (BBC, 2017).
										<br>A large number of internationally operating companies were affected by the cyber attack. These include the Spanish telecommunications group Telefónica, the British National Health Service (NHS), the US logistics company FedEX and automotive groups such as Renault and Nissan, as well as the Chinese oil company PetroChina.
										<br>It is ironic that an agency like the NSA, which is responsible for the safety of its people, is responsible for causing such great national and global damage. On the other hand, such an incident shows the importance of cyber security in today's world and how important it is to keep the operating system up to date.

										<h3>Peer Resopnse 2 </h3>
										<p>Thank you very much for your post Jitesh. With the British Aiways cyber breach case, you addressed a quite interesting industry in relation to cyber attacks.
										<br>Airlines have particularly sensitive data about their customers and are therefore subject to a special duty of care. Not only do they have personal data such as names, nationalities, home addresses, ID cards and, if applicable, account numbers of their customers, they also have information about people's physical movement activity.
										<br>While air traffic has decreased due to COVID-19 in recent years, an increase in flights must be expected again in the next few years. In 2019, 4.5 billion passengers were transported in the air, 3.6 percent more than in 2018 (ICAO, 2020). Every fifth traveler is a business traveler. With more than 30% of the turnover, business travelers make up a large and particularly lucrative share of the turnover of an airline (U.S. Travel Association, 2021).
										<br>Belarusian journalist Roman Protasevich shows that a leak of information can have drastic consequences for airline customers. In May 2020, the aircraft in which he was sitting was diverted from their route by the Belarusian air force and forced to land in Belarus in order to arrest him (BBC, 2020).
										<br>It is clear from this that airlines have a special responsibility with regard to cyber security, since a leak of sensitive data from their customers can not only result in the theft of their data, but also physical consequences for them and international political tensions.

										<h3>Peer Response 3 </h3>
										<p>Thank you Kingsley for your extremely interesting post, which inspired me to reflect critically on ethical cyber security.
										<br>In July 2016, the North Atlantic Tready Organization (NATO) published a Cyber Defense Pledge, which addresses the security threats posed by cyber attacks and is intended to improve the cyber defense of the national infrastructure (Christen et al., 2020: 206).
										<br>A cyber attack on the Iranian power grid that took place in 2010 shows that this goal is of great importance. In June 2010, a malicious computer worm named Stuxnet was discovered that was specially developed to monitor and control a Siemens system. The system controls  frequency converters that have the task of regulating the speed of motors (Fallier et al., 2010: 32-42). Such frequency converters are used for industrial plants such as waterworks, but also uranium enrichment plants and nuclear power plants. In September 2010, Iran confirmed Stuxnet's cyberattacks. 30,000 computers are said to have been affected without causing serious damage, but the power grid was affected (Heise, 2010).
										<br>How credible this statement is, however, is doubtful, since both parties allegedly involved, the USA and Iran, subsequently denied the development or the damage (Spiegel, 2010). It was only found in 2012 that, contrary to the statement, the USA and Israel had commissioned the development of the software (Nakashima &  Warrick, 2012). The following years show that this software was not only used for its (probably) original purpose. In 2012, it is believed that the developers of the malware lost control of the program (Anderson 2012). In 2014 the malware was found in a German nuclear power plant. Espionage is presumed to be the intension (University of Hawai’I, N.D.).
										<br>However, what a malicious, destructive intervention in nuclear power plants could mean can be seen in the two accidents in Chernobyl and Fukushima, in which errors in the control system (in both cases due to a technical failure) led to a nuclear catastrophe. It is therefore not wrong to claim that: "Cyberspace is now seen as the fifth military battlefield alongside ground, air, water and space" (Heise, 2010).
										<br>On the basis of this history, every cyber security specialist, but also programmer in general, should be clear about the scope of their actions in order to be able to make ethically correct decisions.

										<h3>Summary Post</h3>
										
										<br>Cyber security is a multi-dimensional subject area that has to be considered on complex levels and has to meet various demands of aspects.
										<br>While companies have to fear long-term damage to their reputation as a result of a cyber attack in addition to data loss, a cyber breach can affect the democratic system in relation to nations (Troncoso, 2019). In addition to the ethical consideration on a large scale, a cyber breach has drastic consequences for private individuals, as the theft of sensitive personal data not only encroaches on their fundamental rights, but also has direct consequences, such as the theft of financial and intellectual property or even physical hazards, as a result of publication of the place of residence(Ben-Hassine, n.d.). Therefore, Governments have a great interest in monitoring and actively defending in the event of a cyber attack by intervening in corporate systems and supporting companies in closing cyber breaches in order to maintain security (National Cyber Security Centre, n.d.). Even if systems can never be completely secure, companies for their part have the responsibility to design their cyber presence and offerings in such a way that they meet the requirements of their customers and the law, as well as that a cyber breach can be ruled out as far as possible (Mokhor et al., 2020).
										<br>To pursue this goal, the CIA triad model can be used, which addresses the three aspects of information security in a service-related system. These are confidentiality, the protection against access to private data by third parties. Integrity, the security that data is not manipulated and availability, the guarantee of continuous access to the data by authorized persons. (Chai, n.d.) 
										<br>In conclusion, it can be stated that cyber security is of great importance for private individuals, companies and also nations and will become more necessary as a result of further networking and development.

										<h3>Initial Post</h3>
										<p>In order to protect computer systems from harmful interference from outside, there are various options that act on different levels.

										<br>A firewall software installed locally on the computer is referred to as a personal firewall. Their job is to prevent unwanted external access to network services on the computer. It can also be used to prevent applications from communicating with the outside world without the user's authorization. The personal firewall offers an advantage in the case of computer worms that exploit a security flaw in a network service in order to spread (Herzog & Shahmehri, 2007). They can only infect the computer if appropriate network services are available for the worm. Here a personal firewall can restrict remote access to the network service and thus make infection more difficult or prevent it.
										<br>Personal firewalls can protect against some computer worms which spread over the network, but they do not protect against the installation of any other malware. Programs that run on the same hardware as the personal firewall software have far more options for manipulating and circumventing them than with an external firewall (Alfayyadh et al., 2010). A crash or even permanent deactivation of the firewall software due to a software error or malware results in unrestricted access to the previously filtered network services, sometimes without the user noticing.
										<br>A network firewall is predestined to prevent unauthorized external access to the internal system. In contrast to the personal firewall, the internal system does not necessarily consist of a single computer, but can be based on a network of several computers form the internal network (LAN). One such firewall is a Proxy firewall. It is characterized by the fact that, in addition to the pure traffic data such as source, destination and service, it typically also scan the user data, i.e. the content of the network packets (Zalenski, 2002). The typical Proxy filter does not simply pass the network request from the source system on to the target system. Rather, it establishes itself own connection to the target system. Since it communicates with the target system on behalf of the requesting client, it can analyze the packets coherently and influence the connection. From a technical point of view, such a filter works as a communication partner who intervenes in the traffic and terminates the connections on both sides instead of passing the network packets through. The filter itself is a utility program for computer networks that mediates data traffic. As an active mediator, it behaves like a server towards the requesting client, and towards the target system like a client (Herbert, 2021). Since the Proxy firewall must know the communication protocol, there is a separate filter for each higher communication protocol (e.g. HTTP).
										<br>This could be a problem. In principle, any service can work on any port number. If a port for HTTP for example, is enabled in the set of rules, a different protocol can still run over it. Only both communication partners (the client in the internal network and the service on the server from the external network) have to be configured accordingly. In addition, a poorly configured Proxy can be dangerous because it allows third parties to act on the Internet via the Proxy address. As an example, the proxy could be misused for an attack or to send spam. In the event of misuse, the Proxy is then determined as the source, which under certain circumstances can have unpleasant consequences for the operator (Herbert, 2021).

										<h3>Peer Response 1</h3>
										<p>Thank you Aldo for your interesting post about Anomaly Based Detection.
										<br>A major disadvantage of Anomaly Based Detection mechanisms is that they only work with a larger number of sent packets, since they only react with a statistically significant number of malicious packets (Shimeall & Spring, 2014). This can make a system vulnerable to attacks that are carried out by just one or a few information packets, as is the case with an attack such as the Ping of Death.
										<br>Another problem arises from the fact that network traffic is dependent on human behavior. Even if a certain predictability of human behavior is possible, the flexibility of humans can be reduced by a detection mechanism based on anomaly ( Jyothsna et al., 2011). While the system registers and fends off simple attacks, it is susceptible to advanced attacks, which are therefore not recognized, but are of particular interest for a secure system.
										<br>Further problems can be derived from this. It can be a fine line balancing act between an inadequately and inadequately set up anomaly based detection mechanism. Because wanted functions can be exploited in order to execute unwanted applications, since the usage behavior of the unwanted application is very similar to the wanted one and is thus within the statistically significant value. On the other hand, an intended application can be mistakenly recognized as a danger.

										<p>Thank you Zihaad for your post. As a supplement to the Web Application Firewall (WAF), the WAF work on two different types of detection, blacklisted or whitelisted.
										<br>The blacklist detection works with a list of known attack types. If any HTTP request is blacklisted, the WAF will block the request. The blacklist model therefore works with the approach that every request that is not on the blacklist is accepted. It only detects known generic web application attacks and saves the IP addresses and user accounts (Takahashi et al., 2011). A major problem for blacklist WAF systems are zero days attacks, as the newly discovered security gaps are not anchored in the blacklist and can therefore be exploited until they are implemented in the blacklist.
										<br>In contrast to this is the whitelisted WAF model. In this model, the WAF only allows requests that are noted in the whitelist to pass. In addition to a much greater protection against zero days attacks, as well as the lack of known generic web application attacks in the list, the disadvantage here is the effort involved in implementation (Auxilia & Tamilselvan, 2010). Since only whitelisted requests are allowed to pass, every authorized access must be noted in the whitelist. This means a lot of effort for the first implementation of this model of WAF.

										<p>Thank you Jonathan for your interesting and very well researched post.
										<br>While researching packet filtering firewalls, I noticed that there is some confusion in naming and defining such systems.
										<br>A packet filter is a software-based filter for network packets in order to classify them based on their characteristics such as protocol type, destination port, destination address and sender address and then to adapt predefined rules accordingly (Chapman 1999). These filters can accept packets, reject them or simply drop them and thus make the network address practically invisible.
										<br>Of course, a packet filtering firewall also works like a packet filter. However, the firewall is set up on a device specially for this purpose, which protects the entire network. It is not part of the network like a router or a server, but an independent logical component that runs through the entire data traffic between LAN and WAN (Coreth Consulting, 1999). The firewall must be immune to intruders, because the security of the firewall determines the security of the entire network behind it. The advantage of the central firewall is that it simplifies security management(Hertzog & Mas, 2013). The filter rules do not have to be defined individually for each computer. Monitoring also takes place centrally via the firewall. If necessary, it can also trigger an alarm, since external attacks can take place via this defined interface between LAN and WAN.
										<br>In conclusion, it can be said that every packet filter firewall is a packet filter, but not every packet filter is a firewall.

										<p>In review of the well-argued aspects of my fellow students, it can be stated that firewalls cannot be viewed as complementary functions, but rather as complementary ones. Firewalls offer protection against malicious access to individual computers and local networks at different levels and can therefore only offer the highest possible protection through a sensible combination (Müller-Quarde, 2014).
										<br>This can be argued especially under the aspect of the “zero trust architecture” and the ongoing development of mobility options for end devices and the increasing possibility of a device accessing different networks (Samaniego & Deters, 2018). Since, for example, an initially uncorrupted laptop can operate in a secure LAN and can be infected with corrupted software through physical transport and logging into an insecure network, a renewed access of this devise represents a potential danger for the first-mentioned LAN.
 										<br>It is the responsibility of all participants in a network to ensure that it remains secure in the future. The past shows, however, that the human factor is a significant factor in security gaps, despite increased efforts by companies to educate people about how to handle end devices, how to secure them and how they can be protected (Greenwood, 2021). From this it can be concluded that the “Zero Trust” aspect represents a necessary system structure in order to guarantee the greatest possible protection for all participants in a network.

										<h3>Peer Response 5</h3>
										<p>Thank you Thomas for your very interesting post on EDR software and multi-factor authentication.
										<br>Two-factor authentication, which can be seen as a pioneer of MFA, is a relatively long-known technology that was patented by AT&T in 1995 (Blonder et al., 1995). While the MFA was initially limited by a lack of technical possibilities, this type of securing authentication is now a common method. Since 01.01.2021, the European credit institutions have been obliged to offer customers strong customer authentication (The European parliament and the council, 2015). This is made possible by confirming transactions through two independent characteristics from the categories of knowledge, ownership and inheritance.
										<br>The most common method here is authentication using the knowledge category in the form of a password and the possession category in the form of a confirmation of entering a confirmation code sent to the mobile phone. It should be noted, however, that the frequent authentication by SMS can be bypassed in various ways. For example, under the Android operating system, fake apps can gain access to received SMS in order to forward them to fraudsters (Markert et al., 2019).
										<br>In addition, attacks can target the Singnalling System No 7 protocol (SS7) used in the cellular network. In this way, the attackers can redirect the SMS, which is intended for authentication, to a mobile phone they control and thus undermine the security factor of ownership (Gibbs, 2016). In this way, during an attack on the customers of the mobile operator O2-Telefonica, which operates in Europe and Latin America, in 2017, they were defrauded by unauthorized withdrawals from their bank accounts (Price, 2017).
										<br>It should therefore be stated that although MFA increases the security of customers, this technology does not represent absolute protection either.

										<h3>Summary Post</h3>
										<p>Personal firewalls have the task of ensuring the protection of an end device, as well as blocking applications that should not be used. An issue that personal firewalls could have, is that they are not optimally set up because of security gaps or they block the intended applications of the user, which leads the user to turn off the firewall or to modify it in such a way that security gaps arise. This enables attacks in the form of adware, malware, spyware or ransomware (Herzog, 2007).
											<br>Network firewalls, on the other hand, can be divided into three sub-categories, packet-filtering firewalls, circuit-level firewalls and application-level firewalls (Noonan, 2006). They are aimed at protecting LAN (Local Area Networks). While they offer good protection when properly configured, this is often accompanied by disadvantages in terms of usability in relation to network delays (Andress, 2014). For example, proxy firewalls can reduce the flow of data and generate jitter (Hayajneh et al., 2013). In the event of a bad configuration, the connection with other desired communication partners can also be prevented (Firkhan, 2011). A compromise must therefore be found between security concerns and usability.
											<br>As noted with personal firewalls, the human factor also plays a comprehensive role. Careless use of and interference with the firewall system enable attacks and make systems vulnerable to them. Since every development of security systems arouses the commitment of attackers to circumvent this, for example through encryption or spoofing, LAN should be set up under the aspect of "Zero Trust" (Klein, 2021). It is assumed here that a network or its users are already infected and therefore they are also a potential source of danger.
											<br>It can be concluded that single firewalls do not offer sufficient protection and can only offer the greatest possible protection through a sensible combination with other security systems. The human factor plays a decisive role in relation to firewalls and their security and should be limited by companies through restrictions and internal regulations.
