									<p> The European parliament and the council (2016: 1) declared that: “the protection of natural persons in relation to the processing of personal data is a fundamental right”,   as well as of intangible and physical property. To uphold this fundamental right, it is the task of companies, but also government organizations, to take care of the safety of customers and citizens. A breach of this duty of supervision can not only result in reputational damage, but also massive financial damage to people and companies, the leak of personal information, intellectual property or infrastructural damage. <p>
									<p> In March 2021, Microsoft's email transport server software, Microsoft Exchange, fell victim to a cyber breach (Morgan, 2021). Microsoft Exchange is a groupware and e-mail transport server software from Microsoft, which is also part of the Office 365 service. It is used for the central storage and management of e-mails, appointments, contacts, tasks and other elements for several users and thus enables collaboration in work groups, which makes the service particularly interesting for companies (Microsoft, 2021a). The program enables internal company planning and communication to be carried out so that sensitive data is stored on the servers (Microsoft, 2021b). The cyber attack on Microsoft Exchange infected more than 120,000 systems (Turton, 2021). The hack was so significant that the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) stepped in and removed the vulnerability without the companies' knowledge (Collier, 2021). <p>
									<p> The Cyber Security Breaches Survey of 2019 shows that the priority of Cyber Security has increased compared to previous years. Between 2017 and 2019 the costs to companies in the United Kingdom from cyber breaches roughly doubled (Department of Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, 2019: 53). This indicates that cyber attacks are becoming increasingly important and not only companies but also government agencies are interested in Cyber Security. VanSyckel (2018:7) notes that absolute security in cyber space is not possible. It can be concluded from this that cyber security will continue to gain in importance in the future, as further networking with the Internet can lead to new and potentially more dangerous cyber attacks.With this in mind, the designated president of the United States of America Joe Biden, indicated that: “it is more likely we were going to end up in a war, a real shooting war, when a major power it is going to be as a consequence of a cyber breach of great consequence is increasing exponentially” (Bose, 2021). <p>

										<h2>Collaborative Discussion summary post</h2>
										
										<p>Cyber security is a multi-dimensional subject area that has to be considered on complex levels and has to meet various demands of aspects. <p>
										<p>While companies have to fear long-term damage to their reputation as a result of a cyber attack in addition to data loss, a cyber breach can affect the democratic system in relation to nations (Troncoso, 2019). In addition to the ethical consideration on a large scale, a cyber breach has drastic consequences for private individuals, as the theft of sensitive personal data not only encroaches on their fundamental rights, but also has direct consequences, such as the theft of financial and intellectual property or even physical hazards, as a result of publication of the place of residence(Ben-Hassine, n.d.). Therefore, Governments have a great interest in monitoring and actively defending in the event of a cyber attack by intervening in corporate systems and supporting companies in closing cyber breaches in order to maintain security (National Cyber Security Centre, n.d.). Even if systems can never be completely secure, companies for their part have the responsibility to design their cyber presence and offerings in such a way that they meet the requirements of their customers and the law, as well as that a cyber breach can be ruled out as far as possible (Mokhor et al., 2020). <p>
										<p>To pursue this goal, the CIA triad model can be used, which addresses the three aspects of information security in a service-related system. These are confidentiality, the protection against access to private data by third parties. Integrity, the security that data is not manipulated and availability, the guarantee of continuous access to the data by authorized persons. (Chai, n.d.) <p>
										<p>In conclusion, it can be stated that cyber security is of great importance for private individuals, companies and also nations and will become more necessary as a result of further networking and development. <p>
