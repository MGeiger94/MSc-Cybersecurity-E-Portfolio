Welcome to my website for my Master's degree in Cyber Security at the University of Essex, England.
This setup of the website serves as a reflected representation of my personal progress throughout my studies and can serve as an inspiration for others.


Note on website progress:
The website is still under construction. The "About Me" page is currently missing, so the current numbering may raise questions.
Furthermore, the "Contact" and "Footer" areas are still being worked on and do not represent a final version at this point in time.

This is Forty, my latest and greatest addition to HTML5 UP and, per its incredibly
creative name, my 40th (woohoo)! It's built around a grid of "image tiles" that are
set up to smoothly transition to secondary landing pages (for which a separate page
template is provided), and includes a number of neat effects (check out the menu!),
extra features, and all the usual stuff you'd expect. Hope you dig it!
